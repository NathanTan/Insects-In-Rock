                        <p>Music is something of a miracle to me. What we know as sound is nothing more than inconceivably small
                            variations in pressure traveling through the air. Ears and auditory organs vary tremendously
                            across different walks of life but the basic idea is nearly universal in vertebrates. Over millions
                            of years, organisms evolved structures that convert these tiny differences in air pressure into
                            differences in fluid pressure, which is detected by sensory organs, which is converted into a
                            signal and processed by the brain as a sound. I’m not a particularly religious individual; being
                            a biology major, of course my beliefs around the topic of evolution are going to be grounded
                            in science, but I can’t help but be extremely humbled by some of the ways that life evolved its
                            many intricacies, like ears, and the ability to respond to sounds. What I find equally incredible
                            is the fact that we as humans with our overwhelmingly large cerebral cortex, found ways to turn
                            these weird things that we call sounds into a form of art, organizing them in time and putting
                            them together in different ways based on their frequencies. Arranging sounds in innumerable different
                            ways, creating combinations that some perceive as pleasant, and others do not, creating music
                            about anything and everything, and creating entire cultures around different types of music.
                            It’s an awesome part of what makes us human.

                            Humans have shared the planet with insects since before the species known as Homo sapiens had fully differentiated into its
                            own species. Naturally, insects are going to show up in art created by humans, whether it’s thematically,
                            metaphorically, or as a narrative device. There is no shortage of this in my personal favorite
                            genre of music, Rock. I’ve got three songs that I want to share and discuss with you all today.
                            Drones, by Rise Against. Butterflies and Hurricanes by Muse, and Everything Evil by Coheed and
                            Cambria. Each one references an insect or a family of insects in a dramatically different way
                            from the others. Each one gives us an insight into the long standing relationship between insects
                            and humans.

                                Rise Against is a rock band from Chicago, Illinois that was formed in 1999. Along the spectrum of rock, they reside around
                                the punk and harcore area. Their tracks focus on strong melodies and catchy hooks backed
                                up by fast tempos, ripping guitar riffs, and pounding drum lines. As a band, they’re known
                                for their advocacy, proudly supporting a several human rights organizations, and their lyrics
                                are often built around social issues, and human rights. While they are often labeled as a
                                political band pushing a certain ideology, their frontman Tim McIlrath encourages their listeners
                                to look beyond the current political climate, noting that many of the problems they talk
                                about in their songs are issues that have been around for a long time, and will likely continue
                                to exist until a true progress is made.

                                Their song Drones comes to us from their 2006 album, The Sufferer and the Witness. At its core, it is a song about being
                                forced to conform by a system that doesn’t care about you. Apart from the title though, there’s
                                little to no direct reference to insects in the song, so what gives? Insects serve many roles
                                in the art that people make, but the most common association made with bugs, at least in
                                the U.S., is a negative one. Drones are male bees that serve no purpose other than to fertilize
                                the queen of the colony. Many people hear the word “drone” and think of a mindless worker,
                                often assuming drones are just worker bees that never stop what they’re doing. It’s this
                                association that I wanted to point out. Drones in this song serve as a metaphor for a working
                                class that has been marginalized, forgotten, and forced into mindlessness, doomed to work
                                until the day that it dies. The song serves as a sort of overture for the working class in
                                the U.S., for the people who live from paycheck to paycheck. It does a great job of outlining
                                the negative association with bugs that people often make. Moreover, it’s an inaccurate association,
                                most people couldn’t be bothered to look up what role a drone actually plays in a beehive.
                                Still, the song’s message is a powerful one.

                                The european honey bee has a long history with humanity. It is a eusocial member of the order hymenoptera. Honey bees build
                                nests where they house a colony. The colony consists of a single fertile queen, thousands
                                of sterile females called workers and a small number of male drones whose sole purpose is
                                to mate with the queen. A worker bee fits the standard bill for an insect very closely, with
                                a body divided into a head, a thorax, and an abdomen. The head housing two large compound
                                eyes and a pair of antennae. Honey bees have wings, which they beat at about 230 times per
                                second in order to be able to fly. Workers in the colony have several jobs. Some leave the
                                hive in search of flowers from which they are able to take nectar. They bring this nectar
                                back to the hive and “process” it into honey, although it’s really just partially digested
                                in a second stomach of theirs. Other workers have the task of raising young bees. Honey bees
                                undergo a complete metamorphosis during their lives. Eggs are placed into cells of the honeycomb,
                                where they hatched and are fed by worker bees. After some time, the cell is sealed with beeswax
                                and the mature larva forms a pupa, from which a mature worker bee will emerge after a period
                                of about a week. The way in which honey bees communicate has been extensively studied. Bees
                                use a number of dances to convey information such as the location of a food source. Bees
                                also rely heavily on the use of pheromones to communicate with regard to pretty much everything.
                                When threatened, bees have a stinger which is actually a modified ovipositor. This stinger
                                has barbs on the end and make it extremely difficult to remove from the target’s skin. When
                                a bee uses its stinger, it leaves behind a the venom sac, and the bee loses a few vital organs
                                in the process, dying within minutes of administering a sting. Most honey bees are temperate
                                creatures, but they are distributed all over the world, able to be found on every continent
                                except for antarctica. Throughout history, humanity has come to obtain a multitude of products
                                from bees, including but not limited to, honey, beeswax, and royal jelly. The most profound
                                economic contribution that bees make to humans though, is the pollination of billions of
                                dollars’ worth of crops every single year.

                            <p>Hailing from the UK, Muse was formed in 1994. They perform a wide variety of alternative rock
                                and are constantly experimenting and trying to find something new to do with their music.
                                Their sound ranges from grungy, to electronic, to orchestral; they have fun with their music.
                                The seeming spontaneity of their musical style manifests in their lyrics as well, drawing
                                inspiration from just about anything, including a whole album based on George Orwell’s 1984.

                            <p>Their 2003 album, Absolution deals with themes of introspection and personal achievement, as

                                track Butterflies and Hurricanes exemplifies this perfectly. Thematically, it’s a very straightforward
                                song. It’s a song about changing yourself for the better, self actualization; a sort of hype
                                song that tells you “don’t worry, your time will come, everything’s going to be alright.”
                                The song starts off calmly enough, with a simple guitar part and soft spoken vocals. As the
                                verses progress, the drums gradually kick in and the music begins to swell with an orchestra
                                in the background. Eventually the song explodes into a rock anthem that makes you feel like
                                you’re in the middle of the hurricane. The song itself undergoes a transformation and really
                                embodies the life cycle of a butterfly. Compared to Drones, this song is nearly polar opposite
                                in the way it talks about insects. Butterflies and Hurricanes uses a butterfly’s metamorphosis
                                as a very literal metaphor for self growth, self-actualization. It tells you to believe in
                                yourself, that the hurricane will pass and that you will be better when you come out of it,
                                that you’ll emerge as a transformed, beautiful butterfly version of your former self, if
                                you will. It’s a very positive and optimistic view on a butterfly, one that respects it rather
                                than looks down on it the way Drones does on the male bee. </p>

                                <p>Muse’s lead singer, Matt Bellamy, grew up in Cambridge, in the UK. He stated in a 2004 interview with Kerrang that he drew inspiration specifically from the Painted Lady when he was writing Butterflies and Hurricanes, talking about how he would watch them when he was growing up and be in awe of what they went through to become what they did. The painted lady belongs to the order Lepidoptera, and is one of the most heavily distributed species of butterfly in in the world. </p>

                            <p>Coming together in 1995, Coheed and Cambria is a progressive rock band with its roots in Nyack,
                                New York; their style grounded firmly in the realm of rock and hard rock. Their earlier work
                                was mostly progressive, breaking songs up into different, non-repeating sections, rather
                                than the more more traditional “verse-chorus-verse-chorus” style of songwriting. Eight of
                                their seven studio albums have been concept albums, each one serving as a chapter in an overarching
                                sci-fi epic, and this is something that I absolutely love about them. Their lead singer,
                                Claudio Sanchez, write novels and comic books, collectively called The Amory Wars, to help
                                tell the story that these albums present. He has become something of a master of taking experiences
                                from his own life, weaving them into components of this sci-fi adventure, and turning them
                                into songs that are impressively relatable. </p>
                            <p>So what does a sci-fi epic have to do with insects? I’m glad you ask. The story of Coheed and
                                Cambria’s first studio album The Second Stage Turbine Blade is, complicated, to say the least,
                                especially when you have the context of the prequel albums to reference. In an overly simplified
                                summary, the story’s main villain, Willhelm Ryan, unleashes swarms of genetically modified
                                dragonflies. These dragonflies have stingers in place of where normal dragonflies would have
                                claspers. These dragonflies were created with one purpose, to spread the Monstar Virus. Except
                                that most people in this world are completely unaffected by the Monstar and these dragonflies
                                instead are just a painful, irritating nuisance. The Monstar is meant for the titular characters,
                                Coheed and Cambria who are actually very intricate robots, essentially, synthetic life forms.
                                Upon exposure to the Monstar, the titular characters transform into monstrous, nightmarish
                                versions of themselves. In this form, Coheed’s only purpose is to destroy everything in his
                                path, and Cambria’s is to stop Coheed. Wilhelm Ryan did not realize that Coheed and Cambria’s
                                creator installed this sort of failsafe in Cambria, and expected them both beat the planet
                                that they were standing on into submission whereupon Wilhelm Ryan would swoop in, stop them
                                both, and be hailed as a savior. Ryan’s plan fails, and *spoiler alert* both of the titular
                                characters actually end up killing one another. The rest of the series follows their son
                                and his quest to stop Wilhelm Ryan. </p>
                            <p>Believe it or not, all of that happens in the song Everything Evil. The song more or less opens
                                up as Wilhelm Ryan is releasing the dragonflies and the line from the song’s chorus, “evolve!
                                Monstar, do to me the things I never wanted done.” is very much referring to Coheed undergoing
                                his transformation into a mindless, all-destructive version of himself. What I personally
                                find humorous is where the symbolism of the dragonflies came from. As a child, Claudio Sanchez
                                was terrified of dragonflies. He thought they had massive stingers on the ends of their tails
                                and reacted to them the way that many children react to bees and wasps. It wasn’t until a
                                presentation in a class he took in college that he learned that they were virtually harmless.
                                He gained an appreciation for them and ended up incorporating them into the story of the
                                Amory Wars as well as a lot of the band’s iconography. This complicated relationship between
                                Sanchez and dragonflies is another great example of most people’s relationships with insects.
                                Many people fear them or are disgusted by them, but they do not seek to learn more about
                                them and learn to gain a proper appreciation for them. It’s something that i really like
                                about our entomology class, it very much works to educate us and learn about how important
                                they are. After all, they’ve been around much longer than we have, and realistically, they’ll
                                be here long after we are not. </p>

                        My name is Kevin. I enjoy programming from low level kernel development to Node and React web development. I live in Portland
                        Oregon, and work as a junior software developer for the Center for Applied Systems and Software.
                        I'm actively looking for software development jobs in the Portland/Seattle area. During my free time
                        I enjoy cooking, outdoor photography, and powerlifting.
